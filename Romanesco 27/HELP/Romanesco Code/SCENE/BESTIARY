BESTIARY of the Romanesco world

-- Tetrahedron --
> This group of method are present in Mathematic chapter and in Bestiary
void tetrahedronAdd() ; // this method add the four points in a arraylist of point, the shape create have a size of "1"
void tetrahedronClear() ; clear the list of point
int tetrahedronSize() ; return the size of the list
void tetrahedronList(int size) ; // this method draw all points from the arraylist of point, you can use the int size to change the size of the tetrahedron...in this method the list is not clear
void tetrahedron(int size) // display tetrahedron, you can change the size with the int, the starting size is around "one" pixel










-- Polygon --
> It's class to built polygon with n summit.
each polygon have specific component
int ID ;
color color_fill ;
color color_stroke ;
float strokeWeight ;
PVector pos (x,y,z) ;
float radius

You can build polygon with this componant.

Polygon(PVector pos, float radius, float rotation, int num_of_summit, int ID)
The rotation is use to give the orientation of the starting point.

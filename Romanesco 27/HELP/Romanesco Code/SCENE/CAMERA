//SAVE and SETTING Camera and Object orientation and position

whichSetting is 0
afor Romanesco alpha 25 there is only one save setting is 0
for more setting change int numSettingCamera and int numSettingOrientationObject in the void 
createVarP3D() in the tab Variable_Common

// PARALAXE

void paralaxe()
/* give to the world a human vision */



void paralaxe(float focal, float deformation)
Wth this void you can change the paralaxe of the vision
> float focal give the focal like camera lens between 28 mm to 200 mm the min value is like a fisheye.
value between 28 to 200
> float deformation change the ration of the width and height represention of the SCENE,
value between -1 to 1, the "0" value is like no deformation

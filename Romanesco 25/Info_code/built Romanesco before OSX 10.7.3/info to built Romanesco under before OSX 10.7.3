Built Romanesco before OSX 10.7.3

Use Processing 203

Use the library tablet in the folder, because the library from Processing is for the Processing 212 and later.

You must change the name of the Minim Library and Video because in the Processing 3 these libraries is not native.

For the PVector you must use the function .get() not the new one .copy()

Up the memory to 1000 Mega minimum
